# Fantasy Football Draft Assistant - Complete Setup Guide 🏈

## 🎉 SUCCESS! Your Draft Assistant is Ready

Your fantasy football draft assistant has been successfully built and tested! Here's everything you need to know:

## ✅ What's Working

### 🔧 Core Features
- ✅ **PDF Player Rankings Parser**: Extracts data using pdfplumber + OpenAI
- ✅ **ESPN Integration**: Real ESPN API + comprehensive mock data fallback
- ✅ **MongoDB Storage**: Primary database with local JSON fallback
- ✅ **Web Interface**: Flask-based UI at http://127.0.0.1:4000
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and detailed logging

### 📊 Current Database
- **25 Players** loaded from ESPN mock data
- **Positions**: QB (5), RB (8), WR (9), TE (3)
- **Storage**: Local JSON file (MongoDB fallback ready)
- **Data Quality**: Realistic projections and player info

## 🚀 How to Use RIGHT NOW

### 1. Start the Web Interface
```bash
cd "c:\Users\samue\Fantasy Football\ff_draft_assistant"
python app.py
```
Open: **http://127.0.0.1:4000**

### 2. Use During Your Draft
- **Search players** by name, position, or team
- **Filter** by availability (drafted/available)
- **Sort** by projected points or rankings
- **Mark players** as drafted when selected

### 3. Add Real ESPN Data (Optional)
To replace mock data with your actual league:

1. Get ESPN cookies (F12 → Application → Cookies):
   - Find `ESPN_S2` and `SWID` values
   
2. Add to `.env` file:
   ```
   ESPN_S2=your_cookie_value
   SWID=your_cookie_value
   ```

3. Run:
   ```bash
   python populate_espn_enhanced.py
   ```
